# Password Generator

## Description
This application uses front-end web technologies to generate a ([pseudo-random](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random)) password string. It lets users choose password length and a combination of character sets to include in the password.  A password generated by following the short, simple procedure provided by this app will likely be more secure than one thought up on the spot by a user during a website registration process.    

Starter code [found here](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/friendly-parakeet) provided structure, style, and DOM manipulation. [Kitrath](https://github.com/kitrath/) is responsible for the logic used to gather user input and generate the password string.
