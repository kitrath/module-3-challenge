# Password Generator

## Description
This application uses client-side javascript to generate a [pseudo-random](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random) password string. The user answers a [prompt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/prompt) to set password length, and then decides which character sets to include in the generated string through a series of [confirm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/confirm) dialogs.  A password generated by following the short procedure provided within this app will likely be more secure than one thought up on the spot during a website registration process.    

Starter code [found here](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/friendly-parakeet) provided the HTML, CSS, and DOM manipulation code.  This repository builds on that base to provide the logic for user interaction and password generation.

## Usage
1. *Navigate to*: [https://kitrath.github.io/module-3-challenge/](https://kitrath.github.io/module-3-challenge).
2. Click the "Generate Password" button.
3. Answer the series of prompts to determine password length and which character sets (uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters) to include in your password.
4. Select the generated password in the read-only textarea and copy it into your system's clipboard for further use.
